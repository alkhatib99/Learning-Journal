I have learned the CRUD with Django or let's call it `Django-CRUD`

CRUD-Create Read Update Delete, how to navigate to each one also the difference between authentication and authorization, I summarize all of it with some lines 

The Django-CRUD to create a project I need first create poetry project then add Django by "poetry add Django", then active the virtual enviroment then
start the project by using "django-admin startproject <./the_project_name>" create app by using "python mange.py startapp <app_name>", create the models and views include the urls in main urls then use Delteview, ListView,  UpdateView, DetailView, CreateView, then make migrate and migrate the app then can run the server and test it
