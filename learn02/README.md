Today I was more deeper in python code
like how the python code sample, oop in python how to define a class and how to deal with it also the inheritance between these and arrays 
how to deal with arrays in python what 

## Summary

- Lists are a way to store multiple values in one variable.
- Lists can be changed in-place and they have methods that change them
    in-place, like append, extend and remove.
- Slicing lists returns a **new** list, and indexing them returns an
    item from them.
- `thing = another_thing` does not create a copy of `another_thing`.
- Tuples are like lists, but they can't be changed in-place. They're
    also used in different places.
- Use CapsWords for class names and lowercase_words_with_underscores for other names. 
- Calling a class as if it was a function makes a new instance of it.
- Use class attributes for functions and instance attributes for other things.
- Functions as class attributes can be accessed as instance methods. 
- They get their instance as the first argument. 
- Call that self when you define the method.
- `__init__` is a special method, and it's ran when a new instance of a class is created.
- It does nothing by default.
Don't use classes if your code is easier to read without them.
