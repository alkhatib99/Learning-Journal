### What is Data Visualization?

A field in data analysis that deals with a visual representation of data.

It graphically plots data and is an effective way to communicate inferences from data.

---

### Data Visualization in Python

Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way.

---

### Matplotlib and Seaborn

Matplotlib and Seaborn are python libraries that are used for data visualization. They have inbuilt modules for plotting different graphs. While Matplotlib is used to embed graphs into applications, Seaborn is primarily used for statistical graphs.

---

### Line Charts

A line chart is a graph that represents information as a series of data points connected by a straight line. In line charts, each data point or marker is plotted and connected with a line or curve. 

---

### Bar Graphs

When you have categorical data, you can represent it with a bar graph. A bar graph plots data with the help of bars, which represent value on the y-axis and category on the x-axis. Bar graphs use bars with varying heights to show the data which belongs to a specific category.

---

### Histograms

A Histogram is a bar representation of data that varies over a range. It plots the height of the data belonging to a range along the y-axis and the range along the x-axis. Histograms are used to plot data over a range of values. They use a bar representation to show the data belonging to each range. Let's again use the ‘Iris’ data which contains information about flowers to plot histograms.

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are used when we have to plot two or more variables present at different coordinates. The data is scattered all over the graph and is not confined to a range. Two or more variables are plotted in a Scatter Plot, with each variable being represented by a different color.

---

### Heat Maps

Heatmaps are used to see changes in behavior or gradual changes in data. It uses different colors to represent different values. Based on how these colors range in hues, intensity, etc., tells us how the phenomenon varies.
