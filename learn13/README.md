## Overview

***Regression***
<br>
Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning.
There are many regression methods available.
Linear regression is one of them.

***Linear Regression***<br>
Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques.
Itâ€™s among the simplest regression methods.
One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

**Parameters**

<br>
<br>

**fit_interceptbool, default=True**<br>
Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

**normalizebool, default=False**<br>
This parameter is ignored when fit_intercept is set to False. If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm. If you wish to standardize, please use StandardScaler before calling fit on an estimator with normalize=False.

**copy_Xbool, default=True**<br>
If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

**n_jobsint, default=None**<br>
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This will only provide speedup in case of sufficiently large problems, that is if firstly n_targets > 1 and secondly X is sparse or if positive is set to True. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.

**positivebool, default=False**<br>
When set to True, forces the coefficients to be positive. This option is only supported for dense arrays.

**coef_array of shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)**<br>
Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem. If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.

**rank_int**<br>
Rank of matrix X. Only available when X is dense.

**singular_array of shape (min(X, y),)**<br>
Singular values of X. Only available when X is dense.

**intercept_float or array of shape (n_targets,)**<br>
Independent term in the linear model. Set to 0.0 if fit_intercept = False.

**n_features_in_int**<br>
Number of features seen during fit.

***Example***

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
>>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
>>> # y = 1 * x_0 + 2 * x_1 + 3
>>> y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3
>>> reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
>>> reg.score(X, y)
1.0
>>> reg.coef_
array([1., 2.])
>>> reg.intercept_
3.0...
>>> reg.predict(np.array([[3, 5]]))
array([16.])
```
