Today i have learned intro about data science i will give a summary of
 data science defintion and Numpy

## Data Science

> Data Science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structred and unstructured.
> To define data science and improve data science project management, start with its life cycle. The first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system.
> The next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.
> Data processing follows, and constitutes one of the data science fundamentals. It is during data exploration and processing that data scientists stand apart from data engineers. 
> This stage involves data mining, data classification and clustering, data modeling, and summarizing insights gleaned from the data—the processes that create effective data.

## Numpy

> **The Basics**
> NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array.
> It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.
> In NumPy dimensions are called axes.

**Ifound an amazing tutorial i suggest it as resource:["Numpy"](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)**
