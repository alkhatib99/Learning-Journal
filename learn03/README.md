## Summary 

 also used in different places.
- Use CapsWords for class names and lowercase_words_with_underscores for other names. 
- Calling a class as if it was a function makes a new instance of it.
- Use class attributes for functions and instance attributes for other things.
- Functions as class attributes can be accessed as instance methods. 
- They get their instance as the first argument. 
- Call that self when you define the method.
- `__init__` is a special method, and it's ran when a new instance of a class is created.
- It does nothing by default.
Don't use classes if your code is easier to read without them.
