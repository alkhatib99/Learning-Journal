Today I have learned about exceptions, Catching exceptions, When should we catch exceptions?
Raising exceptions, When should we raise exceptions?



## Summary

- Exceptions are classes and they can be used just like all other classes.
- ValueError and TypeError are some of the most commonly used exceptions.
- The `try` and `except` keywords can be used for attempting to do
    something and then doing something else if we get an error. This is
    known as catching exceptions.
- It's possible to raise exceptions with the `raise` keyword. This
    is also known as throwing exceptions.
- Raise exceptions if they are meant to be displayed for programmers and
    use `sys.stderr` and `sys.exit` otherwise.
